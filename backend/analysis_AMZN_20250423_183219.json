  "market_context": "The market sentiment for Amazon (AMZN) is mixed, with both positive and negative news influencing the stock. On the positive side, the overall stock market rally, led by Tesla and 3M's strong earnings, has boosted investor confidence. Additionally, articles highlighting AMZN's long-term potential, such as its dominance in cloud computing and e-commerce, suggest that some investors remain bullish. However, a price target cut due to cloud demand uncertainty and concerns over tariff-prompted economic weakness have also weighed on the stock. Furthermore, the ongoing Trump-Fed tensions and uncertainty surrounding the TikTok ban may also impact AMZN's performance. Overall, while there are valid reasons to be cautious, some investors remain optimistic about AMZN's prospects, citing its strong fundamentals and growth potential. The stock's recent decline may be seen as a buying opportunity by some, while others may be more cautious, waiting for clearer signs of a turnaround.",
